This a JavaScript project
Welcome to my 100daysOfJS challenge! Over the course of 100 days, I'll be diving deep into JavaScript to sharpen my skills and explore new concepts. This repository is a collection of my daily progress, including: Fundamental Concepts: Covering the basics like variables, data types, functions, and control flow. Advanced Techniques: Exploring topics such as closures, prototypes, and asynchronous programming. Practical Projects: Building small to medium-sized projects to apply what I've learned. Daily Logs: Documenting my learning process, challenges faced, and key takeaways.
